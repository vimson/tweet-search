# Objective

The purpose of this test is to build an API endpoint in NodeJS returning tweets from the
Twitter platform given a particular hashtag.

For context, this endpoint is expected to be used by various front end applications to display
twitter feeds for numerous hashtags. Providing an optimum refresh rate will be a key factor.

```shell
API Endpoint: GET tweets/:hashtag
```
